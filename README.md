# STAT167-ResearchProject
Group project done in Spring 2021 at UCR alongside 3 of my classmates.

Over the course of about 8 weeks, each member of the group opted to focus on different areas of interest regarding the effects that "tech hubs" can have on their respective cities.

These areas of interest included:
1. Talent Migration (Orobosa Ogbeide)
2. Commercial Real Estate (Jade Ou)
3. VC Funding and Startups (Jocelyn Chung)
4. Housing prices and Homeless population (Joshua Ortega)
